# Flask_Endpoint

To run the Flask app and test the endpoints, run the following command in your terminal:
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run


Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to see the homepage of your application. 
You can then test the /results and /chat endpoints using the requests module or any other HTTP client.
